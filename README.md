# Yet another discord bot from me.
## Luna.

### Planned to have the same commands as old bots, and maybe new ones.

### Current Change map from each bot
PuppyClanBot -> First bot, all in one file.                                           |  Discord.js

Suzu ->  Minecraft bot, auto-importing commands.                                      |  Discord.js

SuzuTs -> Switched over to TS, dashboard                                              |  Discord.js

SuzuTsV2 -> Self-Hosted website, but lost Dashboard. Overall more-readable code.      |  Discord.js

Suzu-cpp -> Switched to C++, gave up early.                                           |  SleepyDiscord

SpookCord -> Made in one week, JS again                                               |  Custom Eris fork

Shirobots -> Mix between spookcord, and SuzuTs, with the sister bots.                 |  Custom Eris fork

Luna -> Ended life span early, couldn't get the idea to work it windows / arch linux. |  Discord.js

Current -> Switched to rust                                                           |  Serenity

Hopefully, this bot will last longer than the rest.
